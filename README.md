# MAUISounds
This weeks goal was to simply try out the media element component that is included in a NuGet package.
It turned out to be so easy that it was not all that interesting. 


### Lessons
The only interesting thing that I leaned this week is that you can embed media inside of a project and then store it as a variale to be used in certain component attributes.


### Resources
For this week it was just the MediaElement docs that can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/maui/views/mediaelement
